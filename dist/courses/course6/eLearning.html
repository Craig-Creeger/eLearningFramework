<h1>eLearning Features</h1>
<p>This demo showcases what this framework does, but what is an eLearning framework? Elearning courses have several features in common:</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the page are the navigation buttons. At this point in the course you can navigate forward and backward. Once a scored test begins, learners should only be able to move forward through the course.</p>
<h2>Displaying Interactions</h2>
<p>Interactions such as True/False, Multiple Choice, and Fill-in-the-Blank questions are typically built dynamically. There are several advantages including, ease of contruction, consistent styling, and faster page load time.</p>
<h2>Scoring and Displaying Feedback</h2>
<p>After a student has answered the question, the framework must score the question and optionally display feedback. Typically distractor-level feedback is shown during “knowledge checks” and no feedback during “final” tests.</p>
<h2>Tracking Results</h2>
<p>Once the test has been completed, the score is often sent to a server or LMS (Learning Management System). This particular framework saves the score in a MySQL database.</p>
