<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This eLearning framework was developed in the summer of 2015, for a client that I have been working with for several years.</p>
<p>Goals for this project were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a mobile-friendly (small screens) site.</li>
    <li>Target evergreen browsers and IE9+</li>
    <li>Make the site light-weight for quick page load times.</li>
    <li>Make the framework configurable so that future courses will require minimal build time.</li>
</ul>
