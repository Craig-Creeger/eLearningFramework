<h1>Mobile-Friendly</h1>
<p>Letâ€™s explore some of these features in a little more depth.</p>
<p>People spend a huge amount of time on small screens (smartphones and tablets in portrait mode), therefore it is now imperative that all websites are mobile-friendly. This site works well on most devices.</p>
<p>If you are using a desktop browser, vary the width of the window to see how the content flows and the header continues to display well.</p>
<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>This site implements the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is a mobile-first layout.</li>
    <li>There is one major break point in the design at 600px. When the screen is narrower than that the gray background disappears and the font sizes get a little smaller.</li>
    <li>The footer always sits at the bottom of the screen regardless of how much content is on the page (FooterStick-concept).</li>
</ul>
